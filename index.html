        <h2>Motivation and Background</h2>

        <!-- <p class=todo>UPDATE THIS SECTION</p>
        <ul class=todo>
          <li>Update history to include the publication of DCAT-3
          <li>Make it generally shorter
          <li>Include the motivation for VVD and adopting DataCube
        </ul> -->

        <p>Sharing data among researchers, governments and citizens, whether openly or not, requires the provision of metadata. Different communities use different metadata standards to describe their datasets, some of which are highly specialized. At a general level W3C’s Data Catalog Vocabulary, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/">DCAT</a>, is in widespread use, but so too are <a href="https://ckan.org/">CKAN</a>’s native schema, schema.org's <a href="http://schema.org/Dataset">dataset description</a> vocabulary, <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=26020">ISO 19115</a>, <a href="http://www.ddialliance.org/explore-documentation">DDI</a>, <a href="https://sdmx.org/">SDMX</a>, <a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/datasets-cards">Hugging Face's Dataset Cards</a>, <a href="http://www.eurocris.org/cerif/main-features-cerif">CERIF</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/void/" title="Describing Linked Datasets with the VoID Vocabulary">VoID</a>, <a href="http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/index.cfm/pageid/101">INSPIRE</a> and, in the healthcare and life sciences domain, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/hcls-dataset/">Dataset Description vocabulary</a> and <a href="https://github.com/biocaddie/WG3-MetadataSpecifications">DATS</a> (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/103143" title="DATS: the data tag suite to enable discoverability of datasets">ref</a>) among others. The machine learning, AI, and scientific data communities have recently proposed <a href="https://mlcommons.org/working-groups/data/croissant/">Croissant</a> and <a href="https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/">RO-Crates</a> for similar purposes, with an increasing trend of including more fine-grained metadata at the variable level for the machine-actionability of ML/AI models and agents.</p>

        <!-- <p>, which evolved through multiple drafts to improve clarity, extend functionality, and align with best practices. In particular, it introduced dataset series as first-class entities, refined versioning and inverse property handling, enhanced multilingual and accessibility support, improved alignment with external standards, and strengthened guidance on security, privacy, and metadata usage. </p> -->

        <p>Despite the success of the previous WG charter in publishing DCAT-3, the growing ecosystem of standards towards data AI readiness shows that there is a need for describing the variables encoded within datasets in an explicitily and semantically interoperable manner. Variables are a fundamental concept in dataset design, dataset search and model training and compositionality. Variable descriptions are partly covered in existing recommendations like the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/tabular-metadata/">Metadata Vocabulary for Tabular Data</a> (used to annotate tabular data) and the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-data-cube/">RDF Data Cube Vocabulary</a>, QB, (used to describe statistical data and time series). While these recommendations have  been successful and are in wide use, this gap must be addressed to guarantee adoption across different communities, including automated agents.</p>

        <p>The goal of this Working Group is to develop the Variable Description Vocabulary (VVD), a new model for machine-actionable and interoperable dataset variable specifications, enabling users to semantically describe variables contained in datasets and their relationships. The WG will also maintain DCAT and QB by providing extensions for them ensuring their compatibility with VVD; as well as addressing any raised errata for ensuring their relevance and usefulness to the community.</p>

      <section id="scope" class="scope">
        <h2>Scope</h2>
        
        <!-- <p class=todo>UPDATE THIS SECTION</p>
        <ul class=todo>
          <li>Scope should be <em>much</em> shorter and generic (the specifics are given in the deliverable section)
          <li>In particular, input documents should <em>not</em> be listed here
        </ul> -->

        <p>DCAT and QB are formulated as RDF vocabularies and are expected to remain so. However, as with all earlier work, the Working Group is agnostic about data formats. Methods for expressing DCAT or QB in other (existing) formats are in scope.</p>
        <p>Government data, scientific research data, industry/enterprise and cultural heritage data, whether shared openly or not, are all explicitly in scope.  The Working Group will primarily look at cross-domain requirements.</p>

              <p>This document describes how Internet clients may negotiate for content provided by servers based on data profiles to which the content conforms. This is distinct from negotiating by Media Type or Language: a profile may specify the content of information returned, which may be a subset of the information the responding server has about the requested resource, and may be structured in a specific way to meet interoperability requirements of a community of practice.</p>

	  <h2>Success Criteria</h2>

    <!-- Testing and interop -->
	  <p>In order to advance to
		  <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#RecsPR" title="Proposed Recommendation">Proposed Recommendation</a>, each normative specification is expected to have
		  <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#implementation-experience">at least two independent interoperable
			  implementations</a> of every feature defined in the specification, where
interoperability can be verified by passing open test suites.</p>
	  <p>There should be testing plans for each specification, starting from the earliest drafts.
      <!-- the part below is added for this WG, and is based on text from the previous charter-->
      For vocabularies such as DCAT, QB or VVD, the WG should show that each term is used in multiple catalogs and related systems. As a minimum, evidence will be adduced that each term has been published and consumed independently at least once, although a higher number is expected for the majority of terms.
    </p>
    <p>To promote interoperability, all changes made to specifications
      in Candidate Recommendation
      or to features that have deployed implementations
      should have <a href='https://www.w3.org/2019/02/testing-policy.html'>tests</a>.
      Testing efforts should be conducted via the <a href="https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt">Web Platform Tests</a> project.</p>

    <!-- Horizontal review -->

    <p>Each specification should contain separate sections detailing all known security and
      privacy implications for implementers, Web authors, and end users.</p>

    <!-- The specifications of this group do not define any use-facing technology.
         Commenting this out:
	  <p><i class="todo">For specifications of technologies that directly impact user experience, such as content technologies, as well as protocols and APIs which impact content: </i>
		Each specification should contain a section on accessibility that describes the benefits and impacts, including ways specification features can be used to address them, and
		recommendations for maximising accessibility in implementations.</p>
    -->

    <!-- Design principles -->
    <p>This Working Group expects to follow the
    TAG <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/design-principles/">Web Platform Design Principles</a>.
    </p>

	</section>

      <section id="coordination">
        <h2>Coordination</h2>
        <p>For all specifications, this Working Group will seek <a href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/documentreview/#how_to_get_horizontal_review">horizontal review</a> for
          accessibility, internationalization, privacy, and security with the relevant Working and
          Interest Groups, and with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/other/tag/" title="Technical Architecture Group">TAG</a>.
          Invitation for review must be issued during each major standards-track document transition, including
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#RecsWD" title="First Public Working Draft">FPWD</a>.  The
          Working Group is encouraged to engage collaboratively with the horizontal review groups throughout development of
          each specification.  The Working Group is advised to seek a review at least 3 months before first entering
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#RecsCR" title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</a> and is encouraged
          to proactively notify the horizontal review groups when major changes occur in a specification following a review.</p>

        <p>Additional technical coordination with the following Groups will be made, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#WGCharter">W3C Process Document</a>:</p>

        <p>
          To be successful, this Working Group is expected to have 6 or more active participants for its duration, including representatives from the key implementors of this specification, and active Editors and Test Leads for each specification. The Chairs, specification Editors, and Test Leads are expected to contribute half of a working day per week towards the Working Group. There is no minimum requirement for other Participants.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group encourages questions, comments and issues on its public mailing lists and document repositories, as described in <a href='#communication'>Communication</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical submissions for consideration upon their agreement to the terms of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/patent-policy/">W3C Patent Policy</a>.
        </p>
        <p>Participants in the group are required (by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#ParticipationCriteria">W3C Process</a>) to follow the

          Technical discussions for this Working Group are conducted in <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>: the meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review, and technical discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public. Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed in public repositories and may permit direct public contribution requests.
        The meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however.
        </p>
        <p>
          Information about the group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and meetings) will be available from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/dx">Dataset Exchange Working Group home page.</a>

          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#Consensus">W3C Process Document (section 5.2.1, Consensus)</a>. Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
        <p>
           However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.

          A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email, GitHub issue or web-based survey), with a response period from <span id='cfc'>one week to 10 working days</span>, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.

          If no objections are raised by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs.

          This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 5.2.3, Deciding by Vote)</a> and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.
